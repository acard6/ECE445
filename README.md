# ECE445 Water Desalination 
The following is my ECE 445 Senior Design Project. The purpose of the project was to help Professor Jont Allen of the ECE department at UIUC further research his project of desalinatig water and test things out small scale with a prototype. My project consisted of building a printed circuit board(PCB) to house all the sensors in use and read the data from the sensors. From there we would be able to actively control the power to fans, heater, solenoid driver, and air pump. 
The code used to interact with the hardware is located in the directory \Prototyping\src\main.cpp. The code was made developed using the arduino IDE using the serial monitor to read and monitor values of the board.

The PDFs are all written reports of our work from proposal to design to final paper. The zip folders contain the gerber files to our PCB designs. Videos and imges are included to show how the overall system works and our project works.  

Contributions for the code were made by Alan Cardiel, and the hardware and PCB was made possible by Seunghwan Hong.
We used the Adafruit sensor, DHT, and Adafruit MAX31855 libraries in our work.
